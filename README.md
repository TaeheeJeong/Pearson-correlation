# Pearson-correlation
Pearson correlation using Gapminder data

A correlation coefficient assesses the degree of linear relationship between two variables. It ranges from +1 to -1. A correlation of +1 means that there is a perfect, positive, linear relationship between the two variables. A correlation of -1 means there is a perfect, negative linear relationship between the two variables. In both cases, knowing the value of one variable, you can perfectly predict the value of the second. 

I used two quantitative explanatory variables and one quantitative response variable.
-alcohol consumption (litres)
-Income per Person(US$)
-life expectancy at birth (years)

First, I plot the relationship with scatterplots (see figures)

##I generated correlation coefficient between alcohol consumption and life expectancy.
r = 0.2989, p = 7.140e-05
This indicates that the correlation between alcohol consumption and life expectancy is weak even though the p valus is significant since it is <0.05.

##I generated correlation coefficient between Income per Person and life expectancy.
r = 0.5953, p = 8.874e-18
This indicates that the correlation between Income per Person and life expectancy is strong and  the p valus is significant since it is <0.05.
